	<p> Bonjour, ceci est une révision de Git et Github <p>
	
	<p>In computing, the working directory of a process is a directory of 
	a hierarchical file system, if any,[nb 1] dynamically associated with 
	each process. It is sometimes called the current working directory 
	(CWD), e.g. the BSD getcwd(3) function, or just current directory.
	[1] When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or 
	relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from 
	a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the 
	working directory of the process. So for example a process with 
	working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.
	txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt. </p>
